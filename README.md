## RAG-based Query Suggestion Chatbot with Chain of Thought for WordPress Sites 

### Setup Guidlines

1) Access to Wordpress site deployed on Netlify : ( https://663f5b939f93dbd6ae3e237a--musical-concha-221011.netlify.app/ )
   
### OR

2) Access to my WordPress Site on Local : ( https://typical-hands.localsite.io/)
3) Access to Username and Password  when Local Wordpress site is accessed:
 Username : ground
 Password : protective


4) The Wordpress site  and the Chatbot (Flask app)  takes some seconds to load properly.
5) Link to the backend Flask Application hosted on render 
URL : ( https://joyce-merin-abraham-wasserstoff-aitask.onrender.com/ )
NOTE : Only use the WP site to interact with the chatbot. The response to a query will only be displayed if the WP site is accessed as this sends data to the backend. Directly interacting with the flask application will not generate response.

6) Once the Wordpress Site is accessed click on the bottom right chatbot button to trigger the chatbot interface from the Flask API.
7) Users can now ask any question related to the Website.
